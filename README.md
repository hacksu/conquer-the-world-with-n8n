# conquer-the-world-with-n8n

Currently a work in progress. N8n is a really powerful program for automating all sorts of tasks. We will cover how to automate a few cool things!

As a note, the cloud portion of n8n does cost money, but they have a 1 week free trial that we can utilize at the meeting, or I can set up a local n8n environment on a server or machine.

And actually, I want to try to have this lesson not be very advanced and something anyone can follow along on.

There is a very easy to set up free n8n 2 week long trial that we can use for this lesson: https://n8n.io/
